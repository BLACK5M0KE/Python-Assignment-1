    "# 1) What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The difference lies in the type of object created:\n",
    "# - Enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets `[]` creates a list.\n",
    "# - Enclosing a list comprehension in parentheses `()` creates a generator expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of list comprehension (square brackets):\n",
    "list_comprehension = [x * 2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(type(list_comprehension))  # Output: <class 'list'>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of generator expression (parentheses):\n",
    "generator_expression = (x * 2 for x in range(5))\n",
    "print(type(generator_expression))  # Output: <class 'generator'>\n",
    "\n",
    "# The generator expression is evaluated lazily, which means it only computes values when needed, while a list comprehension creates and stores all values immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A generator is a type of iterator. Specifically:\n",
    "# - A generator is an iterator that is defined with a function using the `yield` keyword.\n",
    "# - All generators are iterators, but not all iterators are generators.\n",
    "# - Generators are special kinds of iterators that generate values on the fly and are used to produce an iterable sequence without storing all the values in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of a simple generator:\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "    yield 3\n",
    "\n",
    "gen = my_generator()\n",
    "print(next(gen))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(next(gen))  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A function is a generator function if it includes at least one `yield` statement.\n",
    "# - If a function uses `yield`, it returns a generator object when called.\n",
    "# - Generator functions allow you to iterate over values lazily, one value at a time, without holding all of the values in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of a generator function:\n",
    "def count_up_to(max):\n",
    "    count = 1\n",
    "    while count <= max:\n",
    "        yield count\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "counter = count_up_to(3)\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `yield` statement in a function makes it a generator function.\n",
    "# - It pauses the functionâ€™s execution and returns a value to the caller, saving the state of the function.\n",
    "# - When `next()` is called again, the function resumes execution from where it left off, continuing until it reaches another `yield` or the function terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of using `yield`:\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    yield \"first\"\n",
    "    yield \"second\"\n",
    "    yield \"third\"\n",
    "\n",
    "gen = my_generator()\n",
    "for value in gen:\n",
    "    print(value)  # Output: first, second, third\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both `map()` and list comprehensions are used for transforming data. They are similar in that they:\n",
    "# - Apply a function to each item of an iterable (like a list).\n",
    "# - Return a new iterable with the transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# List comprehension:\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "squared = [x**2 for x in numbers]\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "# map function:\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparison:\n",
    "# - List comprehensions are more Pythonic, easier to read, and typically faster for small-scale transformations.\n",
    "# - `map()` can be used when working with a function that is already defined, or when you want to avoid the overhead of creating a list comprehension.\n",
    "# - List comprehensions always return a list (or another collection type when specified), while `map()` returns a map object, which is an iterator.\n",
