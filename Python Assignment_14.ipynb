    "# 1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "# RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (opacity/transparency).\n",
    "# It is a color model used in digital imaging to define the color and transparency of a pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any image?\n",
    "# You can use the `.getpixel()` method to get the RGBA value of a pixel.\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.png')  # Load an image\n",
    "rgba_value = image.getpixel((x, y))  # Get the RGBA value of the pixel at position (x, y)\n",

    "# 3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "# A box tuple is a tuple that represents the coordinates of a rectangular region in an image.\n",
    "# It typically contains four values: (left, upper, right, lower), which define the corners of the box.\n",
    "box = (100, 100, 200, 200)  # A box representing a region from (100, 100) to (200, 200)\n",

    "# 4. How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?\n",
    "# You can use the `width` and `height` attributes of the Image object.\n",
    "width, height = image.size  # Returns a tuple (width, height)\n",
    "print(\"Width:\", width)\n",
    "print(\"Height:\", height)\n",

    "# 5. What method would you call to get an Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
    "# You can use the `crop()` method with a box tuple that excludes the lower-left quarter of the image.\n",
    "width, height = image.size\n",
    "box = (0, 0, width // 2, height // 2)  # Define the box that excludes the lower-left quarter\n",
    "cropped_image = image.crop(box)\n",
    "cropped_image.show()  # Show the cropped image\n",

    "# 6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "# You can use the `save()` method to save the modified Image object.\n",
    "cropped_image.save('modified_image.png')  # Save the cropped image as a PNG file\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "# Pillow's shape-drawing functions are found in the `ImageDraw` module.\n",
    "from PIL import ImageDraw\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
    "# The `ImageDraw` object allows you to draw shapes and text on an image.\n",
    "# You can create an `ImageDraw` object by passing an Image object to `ImageDraw.Draw()`.\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)  # Create a drawing object for the image\n"
