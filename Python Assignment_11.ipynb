    "# 8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "# Using logging messages is better because:\n",
    "# - It allows for different levels of severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, etc.).\n",
    "# - It can output to multiple destinations (console, file, etc.).\n",
    "# - It can be enabled/disabled based on the logging level.\n",
    "# - It includes timestamps and other useful information.\n",

    "# 9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "# - **Step Over**: Executes the current line of code, but if the line contains a function call, it doesn't step into the function. It \"skips\" over it.\n",
    "# - **Step In**: Executes the current line of code and steps into any function calls, allowing you to debug inside the function.\n",
    "# - **Step Out**: Runs the current function to completion and returns to the calling function, stepping out of the current function.\n",

    "# 10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop?\n",
    "# The debugger will stop when it hits a breakpoint, encounters an exception, or finishes execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "# A **breakpoint** is a marker set in your code where the debugger will pause the program's execution. This allows you to inspect the state of the program and variables at that specific point in time.\n"
