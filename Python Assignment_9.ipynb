    "# 1. To what does a relative path refer?\n",
    "# A relative path refers to the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.\n",
    "# It does not begin with a root directory or a drive letter. For example: \"folder/file.txt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What does an absolute path start with in your operating system?\n",
    "# An absolute path begins with the root directory of the file system or a drive letter (on Windows).\n",
    "# On Windows: 'C:\\folder\\file.txt'\n",
    "# On Linux/macOS: '/home/user/folder/file.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What do the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do?\n",
    "import os\n",
    "# os.getcwd() returns the current working directory (CWD).\n",
    "current_directory = os.getcwd()\n",
    "# os.chdir() changes the current working directory to the specified path.\n",
    "os.chdir('/path/to/directory')\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What are the . and .. folders?\n",
    "# The `.` (dot) refers to the current directory.\n",
    "# The `..` (double dot) refers to the parent directory.\n",
    "# These are used to navigate through directories in relative paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. In C:\\bacon\\eggs\\spam.txt, which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?\n",
    "# 'C:\\bacon\\eggs' is the directory name, and 'spam.txt' is the base name (filename).\n",

    "# 6. What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?\n",
    "# The three common mode arguments are:\n",
    "# 'r'  -> Read (default mode)\n",
    "# 'w'  -> Write (creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates an existing file)\n",
    "# 'a'  -> Append (opens file for writing, appending to the end of the file)\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Example of opening a file in read mode\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?\n",
    "# If an existing file is opened in write mode ('w'), it is truncated (erased) and overwritten.\n",
    "# If the file doesn't exist, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?\n",
    "# `read()` reads the entire file content as a single string.\n",
    "# `readlines()` reads the file and returns a list where each element is a line in the file.\n",

    "    shelf['key'] = 'value'  # shelf behaves like a dictionary\n",
