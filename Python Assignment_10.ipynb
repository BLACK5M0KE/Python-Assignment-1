    "# 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "# shutil.copy() copies a single file from source to destination.\n",
    "# shutil.copytree() recursively copies an entire directory tree, including all subdirectories and files, from source to destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of copying a file:\n",
    "shutil.copy('source_file.txt', 'destination_folder/')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of copying an entire directory:\n",
    "shutil.copytree('source_directory/', 'destination_directory/')\n",

    "# 2. What function is used to rename files?\n",
    "# The function used to rename files is shutil.move().\n",
    "# It can also be used to move a file or directory.\n",
    "shutil.move('old_name.txt', 'new_name.txt')\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "# send2trash.send2trash() sends a file or directory to the trash (recycle bin) rather than permanently deleting it.\n",
    "# shutil functions like shutil.rmtree() and os.remove() delete files and directories permanently.\n",
    "send2trash.send2trash('file_to_delete.txt')  # Moves to the trash\n",

    "# 4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "# The ZipFile equivalent to the open() method for regular files is `ZipFile.open()`.\n",
    "# This method is used to open a file inside a zip archive for reading or writing.\n",
