    "# 1. What is the relationship between `def` statements and `lambda` expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "# `def` statements are used to define functions with a name, allowing multiple lines of code within the function.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "# `lambda` expressions define small anonymous functions in a more compact form. They can only contain a single expression.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "print(add_lambda(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "# The key difference is that `def` is used for defining more complex functions, whereas `lambda` is for simple, single-expression functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is the benefit of `lambda`?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Benefits of `lambda` functions:\n",
    "# - They allow for more compact code.\n",
    "# - Useful for short-lived functions, such as passing them to higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.\n",
    "# - They provide an anonymous function without the need to define a function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example with a map function:\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Compare and contrast `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# `map` applies a function to every item of an iterable (e.g., list) and returns a new iterable with the results.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "# `filter` filters elements of an iterable based on a condition (a function that returns True or False).\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "even_nums = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))\n",
    "print(even_nums)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# `reduce` applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing them to a single value.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, nums)\n",
    "print(product)  # Output: 24\n",
    "\n",
    "# `map` is for applying a function to all items, `filter` is for selecting items that satisfy a condition, and `reduce` combines all items to a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function annotations provide a way to attach metadata to the function's parameters and return value.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:\n",
    "    return f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Annotations do not affect the function's behavior; they are just for documentation or tools like linters or IDEs.\n",
    "print(greet(\"Alice\", 30))  # Output: Hello Alice, you are 30 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursive functions are functions that call themselves in order to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "# A common example is calculating factorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "def factorial(n: int) -> int:\n",
    "    if n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursive functions are used when a problem can be divided into smaller subproblems of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some general guidelines include:\n",
    "# - Keep functions focused on one task (Single Responsibility Principle).\n",
    "# - Use meaningful names for functions and parameters.\n",
    "# - Avoid side effects (functions should not modify global state).\n",
    "# - Keep functions small and concise.\n",
    "# - Document functions using docstrings.\n",
    "# - Ensure functions are reusable and modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions can communicate results in the following ways:\n",
    "# - By returning a value using the `return` statement.\n",
    "# - By modifying mutable objects (lists, dictionaries).\n",
    "# - By raising exceptions to signal errors or unusual conditions.\n",
    "# - By printing results (though less common in modern designs as return values are preferred).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of return:\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "result = add(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of modifying mutable objects:\n",
    "def append_to_list(lst, value):\n",
    "    lst.append(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = []\n",
    "append_to_list(my_list, 1)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of raising an exception:\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    divide(10, 0)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output: Cannot divide by zero.\n",
